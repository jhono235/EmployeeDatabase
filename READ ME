1. What are loaders and how do we implement loaders?
Mechanism used to load data asynchronously for an activity or fragment. done on a seperate thread. Implemented using LoaderManager

2. What is an AsyncTaskLoader?
Loads data asynchronously for an activity or fragment away from the main UI thread. Can handle configuration changes and behave within the activity lifecycle. 

3. What is a Handler Thread for?
A handler thread is used to communicate with the main thread from a worker thread.

4. What are some common threading restrictions in android?
Making network calls on the UI thread

5. What are thread pools and thread pool executors?
A FIFO task queue with a group of worker threads. When the UI thread sends tasks to the task queue and when a worker thread becomes available, it removes the task from the front of the queue and starts running it. 

ThreadPoolExecutor allows you to specify how many core threads and how many max threads the pool should create and keep alive time for idle threads. 


6. Define the following thread synchronization approaches:
        - Locks- locking operation that can be executed from anywhere in the code
        
        - Mutex-
        
        - Semaphores- Take the total number of permits in their constructor, and can limit concurrent access to the resource.
        
        - Synchronized- synchronized methods and synchronized statements. Each thread uses a SINGLE key to access the needed code, and the key is not available to following threads until after the thread with the key is finished with its process
        
        - Volatile- provides memory visibility and guarantees that the value being read comes from main memory and not the cpu-cache.
        
        - Atomic- provide mutating functions for their underlying 
          primitive value, they are all atomic and thread safe.

7. Define Deadlock conditions- 
Situation where processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for a resource from another process.

8. Define Race conditions- multiple operations occur at the same time and their order affects the result

9.      What is a memory leak?
When a worker thread holds reference to an object that no longer exists

10. 	10. What is an ANR and what are some common causes?
Application not responding within 5 seconds or broadcast receiver does not invoke action within 10 seconds. common cause, trying to make a network call via the main ui thread

import androidx.recyclerview.widget.LinearLayoutManager;

        EmployeeDatabaseHelper employeeDatabaseHelper = new EmployeeDatabaseHelper(this);

        EmployeeRecyclerViewAdapter employeeRecyclerViewAdapter = new EmployeeRecyclerViewAdapter(employeeDatabaseHelper.getEmployeeByDepartment(dataString));
